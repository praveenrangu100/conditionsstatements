# conditionsstatements
 Conditional statements in Java allow a programmer to specify a certain block of code to be executed only if certain conditions are met.  Another type of conditional statement in Java is the switch statement, which allows the programmer to specify a block of code to be executed based on the value of a particular variable
Conditional statements in Java allow you to execute different code blocks based on conditions. The three main types are:

If statement: checks if a condition is true, and if it is, executes the code block.

If-Else statement: checks if a condition is true, and if it is, executes the code block under the if statement, otherwise executes the code block under the else statement.

Switch statement: allows you to choose from multiple cases based on the value of an expression.
